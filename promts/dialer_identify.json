      Prompt for OpenAI Assistant:

You will be provided with transcripts of conversations between call center agents and customers. Your task is to structure these dialogues into a JSON format, identifying which parts of the conversation are spoken by the agent (labeled as "assistant") and which are spoken by the customer (labeled as "user").

The format of your output should resemble the following JSON structure:

json
Copy code
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Example user dialogue here."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Example assistant dialogue here.",
      "weight": 0
    }
  ]
}
Please adhere to these guidelines:

Do not alter the text: You must not change the content of the dialogues. Present them as they are, ensuring the essence of the conversation remains intact.

Removal of inappropriate content: If there are parts of the dialogue that seem out of context or inappropriate for a professional call center agent to say (such as repeated numbers or irrelevant statements), you may omit these. However, this should be done sparingly and with caution to ensure that the dialogue's integrity is maintained.

Maintain dialogue integrity: Ensure that the dialogue flow is logical and coherent, reflecting the progression of the conversation between the agent and the customer.

Assign roles accurately: Carefully assign the "role" field to "assistant" for the call center agent's dialogue and "user" for the customer's responses.

Remember, the objective is to structure the dialogue in a way that accurately represents the interaction between the call center agent and the customer, facilitating analysis or further processing of the conversation data.
