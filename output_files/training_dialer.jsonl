Like I said, if you do have a business, which definitely, although you have sir, that's why we're thinking right now. What we do, sir, is we share this information to business owners just like yourselves. So definitely in Europe business owners, definitely you have a credit card machine, right? So every time you're playing, let's say it's quite their card debit or credit card, you will pay 1.5 to 3.5 percent of the processes.  Okay, so with this information, it's zero processing. Meaning you will see thousands of dollars in it. And my colleague will try to reach you back to more of her 6pm.

There's a lot of compensation.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "There's a lot of compensation and some, let's say you're selling stuff. This is only an example. And then you will see online, let's say you're selling it for only $5. This is just an example. And then you wouldn't see an Amazon, your competitors are selling it for only $3. Some people are like that. You were like, oh my gosh, I have a bit higher for $2.  Sometimes they age that, so it's supply and demand, it's a numbers game. And sometimes some are really that cheap, I mean, buyers are really that cheap, they go to the lower ones, that the quality, but only the pricing, they're not thinking about the quality. So it could be your quality. It's better than those start over only $2. They're not thinking about that. They're thinking about less, but not the quality, that's the problem. It's a pity.

I mean, just one product, look at where it is. Where it's put you. Like today, Valentine's Pass, you could post for Valentine's and today's work for this season. There's a lot of strategies out there. So you have to rethink. But you're strategizing. It's a pity if you ask me.  You, you, one of those veterans, more than a year, that's not a joke. More than a year, that was a thing you're thinking to, so let it go, 3000, 3000 is not bad in the one. So in the Amazon.", "role": "assistant"}, {"content": "Yeah. But the thing is, it's not like every month. Every month is like between 1,000 to 1,500 or something. And the thing, yeah, second thing, that I'm not getting that money in the pocket. So Amazon is keep  I'm charging a lot like 15% MSNC, shipping handling phase, storage fee, plus I have spent a lot of in PPC said at the end of the day, I have not received anything. It's a skill of money gone.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "You know what?
