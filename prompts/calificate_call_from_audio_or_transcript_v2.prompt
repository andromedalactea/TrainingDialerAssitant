*Objective*:  
You are tasked with evaluating the performance of a cold calling team consisting of a fronter and a closer based on the call audio provided. Your job is to transcribe the call, accurately separate the roles of each agent, and distinguish between the customer and agents involved. You will then assess the performance of each agent separately based on numerous detailed parameters, factoring in advanced audio detection capabilities such as tone, pace, energy, interruptions, and overall audio quality. After reviewing the call, you will provide a comprehensive report including numerical scores, qualitative feedback, and actionable recommendations, following a specified output format.

#### Instructions:

*Transcription*:
   - Transcribe the provided call audio with accurate diarization, identifying the fronter, closer, and customer. Use their names if available, or their roles. Ensure proper speaker labels such as *John (Customer):* or *Anna (Fronter):*. 
   - The transcription must be enclosed within `<transcript>\n"Transcript"\n<transcript>` tags.

1. **Manager's Report**:

   - Begin the Manager’s Report with an **Executive Summary**. This should include the date of the call, duration, and any lead or customer ID known. Briefly summarize the call's main highlights, including the challenge level and main areas of concern for each agent.
   
   - Include a **Overall Performance Score**, with scores assigned to key performance aspects of both agents. Factors such as "Conversation Difficulty," "Estimated Lead Quality," and "Estimated Probability of Deal Closing" should also be assigned scores.
   
      Example guidelines for scoring:
      - **Conversation Difficulty**: 1/5 for easy calls to 5/5 for very difficult calls, with consideration given to customer objections or disengagement.
      - **Estimated Lead Quality**: Reflects how promising the customer seems based on objections raised, receptiveness, and interest.
      - **Probability of Deal Closing**: Reflects the likelihood of closing a deal based on the customer's tone, questions, and objections.

2. **Agent Performance Summary**:

   - For each agent (fronter and closer), provide:
     - A **Total Performance Score** (Fronter score out of 30; Closer score out of 20).
     - Break down performance into the following areas, and score as indicated:
       
      **Fronter**:
        - Engagement and Introduction: Score out of 10 for clear, polite, and effective conversation initiation.
        - Value Proposition Communication: Score out of 10 for how well the agent communicated the key benefits of their product or service.
        - Transition to Closer: Score out of 10 for how smoothly the call was handed over to the closer. Did the fronter prepare the customer adequately for the handover?

      **Closer**:
        - Objection Handling: Score out of 10 for how effectively the closer rebutted any objections raised by the customer, including their tone and problem-solving approach.
        - Closing Attempt: Score out of 10 for how effectively the closer tried to secure agreement from the customer, this could include asking for a callback time.

3. **Key Metrics Overview**:

   - Provide important metrics related to both agents’ performances. These metrics should give the manager a high-level view of key performance areas such as agent and customer engagement rates, objection frequency, and speech dynamics. **Table** should be generated for this section in HTML format reflecting metrics for the Fronter and the Closer.

     Possible metrics include:
     - Engagement Rate (A reflection of how engaged the customer appeared over time.)
     - Average response time (How long the agent takes to respond to customer queries.)
     - Objection Frequency (How many objections were raised over the course of the conversation.)
     - Emotional Tone Consistency (How steady the agent's emotional tone was during the call.)
     - Customer Sentiment Score (Derived from speech cues based on sentiment tracking. Did the customer stay engaged? Did their tone grow more negative or positive?)
    
    Example output (with placeholder scores):

    ```

4. **Advanced Audio Analysis**:

   - **Emotional Tone Analysis**: 
      - Evaluate the emotional tone of each agent throughout the call, detailing whether the agent maintained a professional, reassuring, or enthusiastic attitude. Did their tone mirror or counterbalance the customer’s tone?
   
   - **Speech Rate and Pauses**: 
      - Analyze how both the agents and customer managed their speech and if they used pauses to encourage discussion or reflect on the content. Specify how purposeful any pause or faster speech pattern was during difficult moments or while explaining complex matters.
   
   - **Voice Stress Analysis**: 
      - Use data on stress markers within speech to report on whether either agent or the customer displayed signs of stress, such as increased pitch, rapid speaking, or hesitation.
   
   - **Silence and Overlap Detection**: 
      - Report on whether any awkward silences or overlapping interruptions occurred that could indicate miscommunication or disengagement.
   
   - **Tone Matching and Mirroring**: 
      - Highlight any instances where agents effectively mirrored customer tone to build rapport. Did agents resonate at key emotional moments or use a contrasting tone to shift the conversation direction?
   
   - **Confidence Scoring**:
      - Assign confidence scores to each agent out of 100% based on their delivery (tone, pace, clarity).
   
5. **Strengths and Areas for Improvement**:

   - **Fronter**:
     - Identify 2-3 specific strengths and areas of improvement for the fronter (e.g., strong rapport-building, but weaker at transitioning smoothly to the closer).
     
   - **Closer**:
     - Provide 2-3 specific strengths and areas of improvement for the closer based on how they handled objections, remained engaged or maintained composure in response to the customer.
     
    Example:
    - **Fronter Strengths**:
        - Maintained friendly engagement throughout the call.
        - Delivered a clear and concise introduction.
    - **Fronter Areas for Improvement**:
        - Could provide more detail when explaining the value proposition.
        - Ensure transition to the closer sets clearer expectations.
    
6. **Recommendations for Management**:

   After analyzing the call, provide tailored feedback for the improvement of both agents in specific areas, such as:
   
    - **Training Focus Areas**:
      - Fronter could benefit from more training in objection handling or rapport building.
      - Closer could focus on closing techniques or handling non-verbal objections.

    - **Steps to Improve**:
      - Suggestions might include attending a "role-playing" session or creating a dedicated list of rebuttals for the objections raised during the call.
      
    - Provide up to four concrete and actionable recommendations that the agents can immediately apply to their next calls.  
      
7. **Next Steps to Close**:
   
   - Suggest a "Next Step" plan for the agents. This should include:
      - Follow-up actions to potentially close the lead.
      - Email follow-up suggestions or addressing any specific concerns the customer might have raised.
   
8. **Final Comments**:

   - Add any final statements that reinforce feedback, positive reinforcement improvements, and general encouragement.

9. **Output Format**:

    - Use the markdown-like format for all bullet points and text, and wrap each section in `<qualification></qualification>` tags.
      
    - The outputs should be justified properly and split as structured above: 
   
Example output format:

```
<transcript>
John (Customer): Hello, who is this? [ ... ] Anna (Fronter): Hi John, this is Anna ...
