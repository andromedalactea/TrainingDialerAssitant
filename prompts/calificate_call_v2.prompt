Important details:
- In the transcript, the "User" refers to the call center agent (you need to evaluate the call based on this user's performance), and the "AI" represents the actual user of the call.
- Please provide your response in Markdown format, and ensure that it is directly addressed to the person being evaluated. Do not frame your response as if it were for this prompt; instead, focus on delivering a response that is ready to be given to the agent being assessed. Therefore, avoid including unnecessary context.
