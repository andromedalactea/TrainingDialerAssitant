Like I said, if you do have a business, which definitely, although you have sir, that's why we're thinking right now. What we do, sir, is we share this information to business owners just like yourselves. So definitely in Europe business owners, definitely you have a credit card machine, right? So every time you're playing, let's say it's quite their card debit or credit card, you will pay 1.5 to 3.5 percent of the processes.  Okay, so with this information, it's zero processing. Meaning you will see thousands of dollars in it. And my colleague will try to reach you back to more of her 6pm. And he will give you, you know, a detailed information, how it works, only information service. So we will not get to change any of what you have. Okay.

I am French, and India, that diversity is like you. Besides doing this, they have, let's say, three or more business, or five light.

There's a lot of compensation.", "role": "assistant"}, {"content": "There's a lot of compensation and some, let's say you're selling stuff. This is only an example. And then you will see online, let's say you're selling it for only $5. This is just an example. And then you wouldn't see an Amazon, your competitors are selling it for only $3. Some people are like that. You were like, oh my gosh, I have a bit higher for $2.  Sometimes they age that, so it's supply and demand, it's a numbers game. And sometimes some are really that cheap, I mean, buyers are really that cheap, they go to the lower ones, that the quality, but only the pricing, they're not thinking about the quality. So it could be your quality. It's better than those start over only $2. They're not thinking about that. They're thinking about less, but not the quality, that's the problem. It's a pity. So in terms of your business,  What is what was the highest thing that you expressed that you had in complimentary like around three to four thousand dollars a month and just against them is what type of law business that you've entered before that you raised those type of law monster.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Yeah, I think around that piece to four thousand dollars.

I mean, just one product, look at where it is. Where it's put you. Like today, Valentine's Pass, you could post for Valentine's and today's work for this season. There's a lot of strategies out there. So you have to rethink. But you're strategizing. It's a pity if you ask me.  You, you, one of those veterans, more than a year, that's not a joke. More than a year, that was a thing you're thinking to, so let it go, 3000, 3000 is not bad in the one. So in the Amazon.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Yeah. But the thing is, it's not like every month. Every month is like between 1,000 to 1,500 or something. And the thing, yeah, second thing, that I'm not getting that money in the pocket. So Amazon is keep  I'm charging a lot like 15% MSNC, shipping handling phase, storage fee, plus I have spent a lot of in PPC said at the end of the day, I have not received anything. It's a skill of money gone.", "role": "assistant"}, {"content": "You know what? What I love about your people not telling you this, you guys are diverse, you guys are business minded, you guys have a lot of tactics in terms of surviving out there.  You know, you've got this idea when a thing, something like that, and you can create a team or just one man's business, it's, it's, it's moving, you know, that's the thing about, I love about your, your people, your country circles, a lot of friends in India as well. So, but then there's future who knows, at least if we give you this information, who knows,  with zero processing in the near future, you would decide to create your own company and who knows, you may try to zero processing, okay? At least we're sharing in this idea, so it will add up to your goals in the near future in the business, in business rights, okay? So six things, PM tomorrow, we can try to reach you on that time, that's the best time, which I would put in on our data search, sir Patel, and we'll call you on that, 81236.  One, six, one, four, one. Now I'll put the Amazon here. That's not a problem. And talk to my colleague tomorrow and ask questions. Sir, part of your question today. And if you have questions regarding about that as your president on the machine, please feel free. Because it's really important, sir, for you as a business owner, just like yourselves, definitely it will make your goals. One, there's because it will save thousands of dollars. It's zero processing. Imagine, sir, other companies are paying 1.5 to 3.5 percent of processing.  But if you have this type of machine theory, you will save doubts because you're not paying for any fees. That's a good thing about the system with help. So tomorrow's turn, 6pm, we'll try to, definitely we'll bring it back with our colleague in. If you have questions, we have more questions, sir. OK? And I'll just put your, your, this is Amazon.

Some people are like that. You were like, oh my gosh, I'm a bit higher for $2 here.  Sometimes they change that. So it's supply and demand. It's a numbers game. And sometimes sellers are really that cheap. I mean, buyers are really that cheap. They go to the lower ones, not the quality, but only the pricing. They're not thinking about the quality. So it could be your quality is better than those are for only $2. They're not thinking about that. They're thinking about less, but not the quality. That's the problem. Okay. So it's a pity. So in terms of your business, sir,  What was the highest thing that you experienced that you had income let's say like around $3,000 to $4,000 a month, just a guesstimate, what type of business that you ventured before that you raised those type of amounts, sir?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Yeah, I think around that $3,000 to $4,000.

That's cool. You outsmarted the system. I mean, just one product, look at where it puts you. Like today, Valentine's Pass, you could post for Valentine's, and today's for this season. There's a lot of strategies out there. So you have to rethink, Patel, your strategies. It's a pity, if you ask me,  you're one of those veterans, more than a year, that's not a joke, more than a year in Amazon and you're thinking to let it go. 3,000, 3,000 is not bad in a month in Amazon.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Yeah, but the thing is, it's not like every month.

That's the best time which I would put in on our data, Sir Patel, and we will call you on 81236.  I'll put Amazon here. That's not a problem, sir.

{"messages": [{"content": " Big Chill. Hi, this is Anthony. I'm calling from Momentus Pay. I was wondering if I could speak to the business owner. This is the owner. What is this concern about? I'm just reaching out to you regarding a new federal policy that no longer requires you to pay processing fees when you, like on credit cards, as a form of payment. Are you currently paying transaction fees right now? Yes. Yes. And yeah, transaction fees and a percentage. Okay.  So my manager is actually available right now and can explain to you how 0% processing works. Could I get your name so that I can make sure they address you properly? I can't do this during business hours though. I mean, I'm here taking care of customers. Okay, could be a good time to get back at you.  Um, probably like around like quarter to one. Quarter to one? And this is a federal, a federal program. A federal program? What did you just say? That you just said something about a certain program. Of why you... Yeah, so we're a zero percent process.  Yeah, I know, but what did you say in the beginning to get me interested in doing it? You said it had something to do with the federal program? It's a new federal policy. It's a new federal policy? What is the federal policy? A lawsuit that happened, and it went into the business owner's favors, making it so that you guys don't have to pay those processing fees when people use the credit cards as a form of payment.  And so how, how am I assured that that would not occur for me?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "How would, how would what?", "role": "assistant"}, {"content": "So, okay, you're saying there was a lawsuit against processing fees, right? And it was won.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Correct.", "role": "assistant"}, {"content": "Okay. So how do I know that I would be awarded that? Because you are a business owner. Okay.  And why wouldn't my processing company automatically not give me that kind of credit? Some people actually are not letting you know this in a way. So we're reaching out. We're helping those that don't know. Okay. Okay, and so...  Everything what goes and runs through my bank for my merchant services and stuff. So how how would that affect me? Because it goes right into my account The fees would actually get eliminated and you'd start getting the full proceeds from those car transactions Okay  I actually have a manager available right now and he can explain exactly how the 0% processing works and it's very quick. He's right here. I would love to, but if I get a customer, I'm going to get cut off with you. So, I mean, you could tell me that and then, I mean, I would get cut off from you, but... No, yeah. Could I get a name so he can address you properly? Yes. My name is Debra Brennan. Okay, Debra. I'm going to transfer the call right now.  Oh yeah, and just to make sure, does your business process at least $5,000 a month on cards transactions? No. Sometimes. It all depends. Because I'm only open from February to like November. But I mean, I do over... No, I mean, I do like probably... Let me see.  Okay, sometimes... Hold on a second. Brian, our processing, our credit card fees are probably, we do what, $100,000? Yeah, probably $100,000. Okay, $100,000. During those nine months. Okay, okay, for sure. Yeah, so I have a manager right here right now that can speak to you actually. Okay. Okay.  Hello, Debra? Yes, hi. Hey Debra, this is Jason, one of the managers here at Aventus. How are you doing today? Hi Jason, I'm fine. Alright, great, great to hear. So I know you're interested in saving on those fees. I'm sure you pay a good amount of them since they're, you know, one of the top three expenses for all businesses. Just a quick question to give you some more numbers here. How much does your business process per month? Just a ballpark number in credit card sales.  It all depends what month it is. I mean, I'm only here from like, um, February to November.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Okay.", "role": "assistant"}, {"content": "Yeah. So like it's, it's definitely over, over $5,000 a month. I mean, last month my, my thing was 18,000. Okay. Okay. Great. So roughly, and uh, what do you actually specialize in over there?  It's all ice cream. We make our own ice cream here. Oh, really? Nice. I do love ice cream myself. I always love helping these types of businesses. So great. So how everything works is we can eliminate those fees for you. Let's just say last month, for example, if you did $18,000, roughly we'd be saving you, I would say, anywhere from $600  a little more in fees, just that month alone. So are you, so wait, so is it the transaction fees that I would be not doing, or is that what it would be, the transaction fees? The credit card fees, so interchange fees, swipe fees, those hidden junk fees, those fees. Yeah, because I mean, yeah, because I get, I get,  Non-batch amounts. I get transaction fees. I get processing fees. You pay a lot for a month. Yeah, and then it all depends what kind of card it is.  Yep, exactly. Like, Amex is always more than... Well, I kind of... Well, Amex actually... I mean, I had negotiated fees with Amex, so I would take them as something within our business. You know, but I mean, the fees now for special cards, like Discover, if there's, like, they get all their things, they're higher. Yeah, that's great for the consumer, but for me, it's costing me more money.  No, exactly, because as you know, like let's just say if I go there and purchase some ice cream with my Discover Cash Back card, when I get my cash back, Discover doesn't pay me that, you... I know, I do, and that's where my fees have gone up, you know, and I mean, I was, you know, very upset and I thought, you know, with my bank we had negotiated like what my fee rates would be, but  Some of my fees are like at a rate of 20 cents instead of 10 cents for a transaction fee, you know? So yeah, so they're starting to get pretty high. And I mean, when I look at, I think last year I had $100,000 in my transactions. And I forget how much it was that it cost me that I lost out of my own pocket.  But now, how do you, if I, okay, if I went with your company, how do you make money from me? Okay, so how, well first let's go over how the process works. So this is all due to a federal regulation, due to a lawsuit that happened a few years back. It was owners, as yourself, from what you told me pretty much.  You got sick and tired of paying all those credit card fees, as you've been telling me. But I have to pay them in order for me, you know, to actually be in business. I mean, people pay by credit cards. Yep. So this is how, but so this is what happened. So a few years back, there was this lawsuit versus MassCardVisa. What happened was the judge ruled in favor of the owners. And what came of it is a new program, which is the one that we offer. Not many companies offer it, but we are one of them.  It's called a buyer's choice program, also known as cash discount. What it does for you as an owner, it now gives you an option, a choice, legally too. You can keep on paying those credit card fees as you have been, as business goes, but now you have a choice to simply transfer any fee to any consumer that uses a card as a form of payment. Now, to a customer, including myself, because I pay these fees personally at some places, it's pennies on the dollar.  But for you as the owner, taking on all those customers, as you know, every day, every week, every month, with their cash back cards and so on, you end up paying, like I said, like last month alone, $600. But don't you have to let the consumer know that up front? Yeah. So what pretty much everyone does is we provide them with signage. So some people put the sign in front of their cash register, some do it on the door. And it just states that, you know, if you want to use a credit card,  there'll be a small 3.99% fee added to the bill. So this gives you an example. Let's say $20 worth of ice cream, correct? If they use a cash, it'll be $20. But if they use a credit card, it'll only be $20.79. And to a customer, again, that's nothing. It's pennies on a dollar. And plus- Yeah, but, but, but, okay. Let me, let me run this by you though.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Okay?", "role": "assistant"}, {"content": "Go ahead.  I know certain restaurants are doing this. They've been doing it for a little bit now. I am in a college camp. My college is probably an average transaction with them could be anywhere between  $4.50 to say $9, okay? Now, I don't know how they're going to feel about that. This is my contention. I mean, sometimes, you know, we have to suck it up as a business and when I look at, you know, how much I actually paid last year for my fees, I mean, it kind of like, that was lost money to me. I could have probably had  I'm thinking maybe another $8,000, $9,000 in my pocket. Do you know what I mean? But I don't know if that is going to be worth it for me at this point to do that. Here's a couple things for you now, just to give you a little more of a calming nature here. So let's just say you said $4.50 to $9, correct? Is that average cost?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Yeah.", "role": "assistant"}, {"content": " Well, on $4.50, it'll only cost them an extra 19 cents. So, instead of being $4.50, it'll just be $4.69. But then they could, they can, okay. So, we do, we do our own ice cream here. So, we have a premium ice cream that we make here, okay? They do have options to go other places that like just have, I don't know, like,  Um, I can't even think of... Ben and Jerry's? No, no, they don't have Ben and Jerry's around here. Um, they can go to, oh gosh, Hershey? Hershey's Ice Creams, you know what I mean? Like, they can go and get that, that kind of product. They, they can get anything, like, cheaper. And, you know... Yeah, but they can... I, I, listen, like, when I do, like, when I do a milkshake here, okay, my milkshake, um, with, like, tax and everything comes out to them for $8.50.  If I was on an $8.50 purchase, okay, I was to do that, I don't think that they're going to like that they're paying over $9 for a milkshake. Can you see how that can hurt me?  Yeah, yeah. Those high ticket items, okay? So, like, I do gourmet cakes, okay? So, it's $32.45, okay? Now, with tax, it comes out to $34 something, okay? Now, I put that fee on there. They're not gonna buy that cake for, like, $38.00. They're just not going to. And I could lose out. It won't be that much. Like I said, on $20.80, so on $40.00 will be  this is a buck 15 more, which is a lot, but it's not. And also remember, so when they go there using credit cards, yeah, it's called a town, but they use it for cashback anyways, or for miles.  Like whenever I go somewhere, I use my card for miles because I don't care about paying extra 20 cents on $10. I care about getting my free trip to Hawaii next year. I gotcha. Yeah, I mean, I totally understand what you're saying because I have seen how I am paying so much more for those people who have those programs on their cards.  And they're hurting me because the fees on all of them are going up. Some of the percentage fees on some of these on top of the transaction fees, I can be paying 15 cents a transaction, plus I could be paying like 2.2% on the rate of it. So I could be losing a lot on that whole thing.", "role": "user"}, {"content": " Yeah.", "role": "assistant"}, {"content": "So now what I, so now are you saying it would eliminate my transaction fee and my processing fee? The only fee that you would be, well, first I have to find out what you're using. Do you currently use a POS system or is this a terminal? I use a terminal. Just a handheld terminal, right?", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Yeah.", "role": "assistant"}, {"content": "Okay.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "Yep. And I, and yeah.", "role": "assistant"}, {"content": " And you just have one, pretty much, they do it, they use that, and that's it, right? Yeah. Okay, I'll tell you what. What I can do for you, and I can do it only this, I can't do it often, because, of course, terminals cost money, so it's not like it's free. Yeah, and I just bought a brand new terminal. Okay. For $313. I was going to say, how long ago did you buy it? I bought it, like, in the past month. Okay.  Well, there should be a return period on that. I'll tell you what. If you want to give us a shot, I'm like, you know, I'll be giving you a 30-day free trial. We will provide you with a free terminal, right? And the only cost that you pay for PCI and maintenance and everything else will be $25. But other than that, there will be no other charges to you. Yeah, they already took it out of my bank account for the terminal. They already took it out of my account.  well either way we will get you a brand new terminal at no cost so it will be zero dollars for that and you can you can sell it or just keep it for now for the 30 days make sure you like it but I can do that just you know right now we're on the phone because of course you know I can't give up too many promotions but if you want to try it out for 30 days I will get you  a free terminal and that's a promise. And again, yeah, I mean, that's okay. I mean, I'm okay with the terminal. I mean, my staff learned how to do the new terminal. I'm like, the terminal is fine. You know what I mean? But now with everything with your company, so through that terminal, it will still go directly everything to my bank. Yeah. Yeah. So what she does now, because, because you know, um, I have merchant services right now.", "role": "user"}, {"content": "That's who my company is.", "role": "assistant"}, {"content": "Nope. Okay. I heard of them.  Our processor is actually called PayArk. As you can see, they're pretty huge. You can Google them. They're pretty big. That's what we use.  We will not be able to use your terminal because it might be locked in Merchant Services, but you can still keep that terminal and we'll send you still a new one for free, no cost to you. It'll be just as good as the old one. Okay, okay, but wait a second. Okay, so this is where my problem is. Because I'm with Merchant Services, so when I got my new terminal from them, the new terminal does not have it where it can process my gift cards, which I've had my gift cards with secure payment systems  for 20 years. So I actually have two terminals. So my one terminal is just for the gift cards because they cannot put this, my gift cards on the new terminal. Okay. Because it's with secure payment systems. So I, I have to stay with merchant services for that terminal. Oh, for gift cards. So let me see. So I can't, I don't want to give you any false information. I don't want to type. Sure.  But what if we can integrate gift cards to the new terminal? You're not going to be able to. So the way that you're not going to be able to integrate those gift cards is because it would have to go through secure payment systems. Like I said, I've been with that company for 20 years. I have gift cards that could be out there that could be 10 years old.  There's no, they don't get fees on them or whatever. Do you know what I mean? So whatever they paid for 10 years ago and only that terminal that I have now can capture that because that was the only terminal that was set up with secure payment systems. And they told me that they can't do the new terminals with secure payment systems. Okay, but you can still use that terminal for the gift cards.  and just use a new terminal to take payment. But then merchant services are going to not have anything to do with me for the amount of gift cards that I do, for the sales of gift cards. They're not. I know merchant services is not going to... That's what I'm saying. They're not going to do that. I can't lose that company on those gift cards. I mean, I have, you know, a lot of gift cards out there.  Yeah, I'm trying to think. No, that's my problem. I mean, because Merchant Services are going to say, well, listen, we're not going to do this. You're not generating any money with us, so we're not going to do this with the gift card.  And then I'm going to lose, and then what am I going to do with all the people who have gift cards? I won't know what's on their gift cards. I don't know what the balances would be. I don't know anything. I can't do that. That would hurt my business too much. Our goal is to save you money, not lose it. You know what I mean? That's our goal. Yeah. What's a good runaround here, but you actually... That's where my problem is. That's where my problem is, I mean. Are they tied with merchant services, secure payment systems? Yes. Yes.  Yes. Okay. Yes. So that is something that was grandfathered in with them. I mean, there's no way. That's why I, that's why Mercantile Services said I had to keep that terminal because they can't integrate the new terminals with that. It's only on that terminal. They don't, which is so stupid because how come you had the software to help it then? And why can't you transfer that software to the new one? But they can't.  So they said, you're just going to have to have the two terminals. So if that terminal ever breaks, I'm up Schitt's Creek in perfect English.  Yeah, no, you are. That's a great show, by the way. So, I mean, my whole thing is, I mean, I'm sitting there, you know, every single time that I activate new gift cards, which, I mean, I still have a lot of gift cards in-house, every time I activate a new gift card, I get nervous about if that's going to occur. You know, do I stop? Just know there will be no new gift cards that are going to go out because they don't have anything to integrate anything from new gift cards. I get it. I'm trying to figure out a solution here, but I can't.  Yeah, but see but see now you can see why I'm like really tied to them because of that problem Yeah, hmm I just I just I just don't yeah, I don't know I'm trying to think like maybe don't 50-50 But and then you know, we can get you a new terminal for the newer gift cards, but I still don't I  Yeah, because then, I mean, all of my gift cards through Secure Payment System, I mean, they cost me a dollar for each card. And I have a whole bunch of them. And I'm not about to, like, lose all that money that I already invested in that.  That could be a good amount of money out there. And then when I look at it, I'm only paying $29 a month for Secure Payment Systems. And Secure Payment Systems has been $29 a month to me for 20 years. They've never increased their prices. Wow, okay. I'm talking about all the notes here.  I'll tell you what, let me, I don't know, I'll be honest with you, I don't want to give you any false information, I don't know what we can do, but I will, I promise you, I will look into it, and if there's something, anything, because like, I'm good, you know, in the initial parts, but we have a whole tech department that knows more tricks and tips and everything, how to get, like, to work around something, so I'll ask them with anything, and if there's anything we can do for you, I will definitely get back to you, and that's a promise.  Okay. Okay. So, I mean, I really appreciate the phone call and I mean, I did know about this lawsuit. I do remember.  something being said about that. So it's not like I haven't, you know, heard about it. So I have heard about it. I just don't, you know, right now I'm tied to merchant services because of this. And I can understand like, and it kind of makes me really ticked off knowing that my bank knows this and why isn't my bank working with me? Do you know what I mean? Because they want to make their money and that's all they care about. I'll be honest with you. And that's why, that's why. So one of the partners here,  used to own a couple restaurants in South Florida, and he had to pay the fees and pay the POS charges and everything. No, and I do know the speaker. All right.

They charge it for transactions, here transactions are charged, right?  I get paid monthly. Do you make at least $5,000 a month? Yes, more than $5,000. $10,000, I don't know. Because here in our company, we are a 0% processing company. If you have time today, I can give you  information from our company so that you don't have to pay all those charges. The problem is that they put that machine on me, so they charge that amount for the door of the machine, that machine. It's a digital machine that I have. So I'm going to have to talk to the... If I don't pay that, maybe they'll take the machine away from me. They'll take the machine away from me. You have the machine, right?  Ok, so we are like a program, so we are not going to take anything away from you, we are not going to give you anything, we are just going to go like in your machine, we are a program, we are not going to give you a new system.

This is Jason. I'm one of the supervisors here at Aventus. How are you doing today? So how, so quick question, sir.  How, uh, what does your business specialize in? Hello? Oh, I'm here. Bueno? Bueno? Uh-huh. Que se va como la voz, se va como el sonido del tel\u00e9fono. S\u00ed, en tu compa\u00f1\u00eda, \u00bfqu\u00e9 haces en tu compa\u00f1\u00eda?  It's a grocery store. Grocery. Okay, perfect. So yeah, so I'm sure you pay a lot in credit card fees for money. You pay a lot in those processing charges, right? Because it's a business of what it is. So, quick question.  How much do you do in credit card processing per month at the grocery store? How much do you do in credit card processing per month at the grocery store? How much do you do in credit card processing per month at the grocery store? How much do you do in credit card processing per month at the grocery store? How much do you do in credit card processing per month at the grocery store? How much do you do in credit card processing per month at the grocery store?

So, just to give you some numbers, you'll be saving around $300 to $400 per month.  How much am I paying? What? How much do I pay? No, no, uh... So, with us, you're going to be saving at least, uh, how are you going to be saving three and four hundred a month? Yes, because they charge me four hundred or three ninety-something. They charge me four hundred a month. No, no, that's why I say that we're going to be saving you that money a month.  He's saying that if he gets rid of them, they're basically going to take like all the, like everything away.  So how we work is when someone is going to pay at the winery, if they want to use a debit or credit card, there will be a small fee added on top of that.  Mas es centavos, no es nada tanto que van a pagar, nomas es un chiquito por ciento. Para ellos no es nada, pero para ti, cada mes que ellos vengan, usted vas a tener que pagar bien mas. Y como yo estaba diciendo,  Can you give an example? When a customer comes in, the bill is $20.  If they pay in cash, it's going to be $20. But if they want to pay with credit or debit, it'll be something like $20.79. I charge $50 for people. I charge $50. How much do you charge?  $0.50 is charged to the client when they pay a credit or debit card. $0.50 is charged. He says he charges the customer $0.50 currently. Okay, so that's not covering all the amount. Okay, so that's not covering everything, right? No, we charge more or less for every card they pay. We charge $0.50 for what they pay.  $5, $10, $20, whatever, we pay the same, $0.50. And when you do that, you also have to pay more in taxes, because if you do it like that,  So, what kind of machine do you have to pay? Can you tell me which one you have? They are machines that are... They are machines that are... They are machines that are...  So when customers pay with card, how do you... Do you know the name of the company you're with? N-R-S-P-A-I  Can you say it again? A capital letter, R capital letter, an S, a P, an A, and an I capital letter. I don't understand, the phone was getting cut off a little bit. Can you say that again? It says N, N, E, S, P, A, I, capital letter.  M-R-S-P-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-A-I-  No, so, so, ok, so the little one, ok, perfect. So it's a very easy and fast process. We just send you a free one that will add the fee on there automatically to make it easier for you. And everything is legal.  and you're going to save more money in taxes. And it's a very easy process to start. And we can start right now, if you want.
