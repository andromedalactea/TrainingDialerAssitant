There were several instances of hesitation and filler words ('uh', 'um') that affected the flow of the conversation. Empathy was minimal; the agent did not make any effort to connect with the business owner on a personal level. The resolution efficiency was average; the agent introduced the program but did not provide detailed information or next steps. The rebuttal appropriateness was neutral as there were no objections to handle. Overall, the interaction quality was average, with room for improvement in clarity, empathy, and providing more detailed information.\"\n}",

The resolution was not very efficient as the agent did not probe further to understand the business owner's needs or offer alternative solutions. The rebuttal was weak; the agent did not attempt to address the business owner's disinterest or provide additional value propositions.
